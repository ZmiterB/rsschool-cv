### About myself ###
***

After obtaining Diploma in Law I was working for governmental agency for almost sixteen years. Along the way I managed to get linguistic educations which allowed me to get significant promotion. But a couple years ago State service disapointed me entirily and despite comfortable position I made decision to dismiss. For the time being I have great desire to radically change my life and become front-end developer.

Since I have no any previous experience in coding on this stage I decided to insert in my CV a peace of someone's __code__ just to fulfil the task:  

```
const baseValue = prompt('Enter the base of a triangle: ');
const heightValue = prompt('Enter the height of a triangle: ');

// calculate the area
const areaValue = (baseValue * heightValue) / 2;

console.log(
  `The area of the triangle is ${areaValue}`
);

```
